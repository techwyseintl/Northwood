This important insurance coverage will pay-down or pay-off the mortgage in event of a death or long-term disability.\r\n\r\nWe offer the following programs including:\r\n\r\n* Mortgage Life Insurance\r\n* Mortgage Disability Insurance\r\n* Mortgage Critical Illness Protection\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of our programs include:\r\n\r\n# No medicals or bodily fluids required for certain products\r\n# Fast, Guaranteed Issue products\r\n# Disability coverage that can help make loan payments \r\n# Return of Premium Products that refund all paid premiums.\r\n# Guaranteed Premiums rates Ð they donÕt increase with age.\r\n# Portable insurance that goes from mortgage to mortgage, house to house\r\n\r\nTo Receive Your Free No Obligation Quotation, please call John Klotz at 416-969-8130 ext. 230 \r\n\r\nh2. FAQ\r\n\r\nh3. Why do I need Mortgage Insurance Protection?\r\n\r\nYour mortgage may be a new financial obligation you did not have when you acquired your existing life insurance, so you may not have enough benefit to pay off the mortgage in a case of disability, critical illness or death. \r\n\r\nIn addition, work disability protection typically covers 50-70% or less of your gross income. Will half of your salary cover your annual bills?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Do I need Mortgage Insurance coverage if I already have coverage from my employer?\r\n\r\nWork benefits are great, but they are controlled by your employer and end when you leave your job, regardless of the reason. Do you know how much protection your employer provides? Would it pay-off your family\'s debt and home mortgage if you died? If not, Northwood Mortgage Life is your answer.\r\n\r\nh3. Couldn\'t my estate just sell my assets if I die?\r\n\r\nYes, your estate could liquidate your assets, but how much are they worth? If your family sold everything you own would they make that much? For most of us, our estates are not that valuable and few people have those dollars in the bank. \r\n\r\nMortgage Life Insurance and Disability Insurance Policies offer living benefits to make your mortgage payment in case of disability and critical illness. In addition, it is possible to get all your money back at the end of the policy.\r\n\r\nh3. Is a medical exam required to apply for coverage?\r\n\r\nThere are many policies out there that do not require a medical exam.  Based on the answers you provide regarding the policy\'s health questions, the carriers may only require additional information from your doctor. \r\n\r\nh3. If I\'m turned down, can my spouse still get coverage?\r\n\r\nYes they can. Many policies have insurability and underwriting guidelines that are broad and liberal. However, some applicants may be declined. If that happens, you and your spouse may apply for separate policies \r\n\r\nh3. Does the Mortgage Insurance premium increase as the mortgagor ages?\r\n\r\nWith many of our programs, the premiums stay the same as you get older.   \r\n\r\nh3. How do Mortgage Insurance premiums get paid?\r\n\r\nNorthwood Mortgage Life offers many payment options and our agents will explain them to you in detail. They may include credit card, electronic deposits or other suitable methods\r\n\r\nh3. When does Mortgage Insurance coverage become effective?\r\n\r\nWith Mortgage Insurance in most cases, right away, but your Northwood Mortgage Life Insurance agent always makes sure you understand any special conditions that apply. \r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditional Receipt: A receipt given for premium payment accompanying an application for insurance. If the application is approved as applied for, the coverage is effective on the later of the date of prepayment or the date on which the last of the underwriting requirements, such as medical examination, has been received by the insurance company. A conditional receipt for premiums paid upon application may protect the proposed insured from changes in health occurring after the application and funds have been submitted to the insurance company._\r\n  \r\nh3. When does Mortgage disability insurance coverage terminate?\r\n\r\nMortgage Insurance coverage remains in force until the policy term ends or until you reach age 65. (If your spouse is also covered and is younger than 65, your spouse coverage remains in effect until he/she turns 65.)\r\n%p All Mortgage Insurance coverage stops if you discontinue premium payments or if you request termination of your policy. \r\n\r\nh3. Who is the beneficiary of my Mortgage \r\n\r\nMortgage Insurance proceeds are paid to the beneficiary you designate. This allows your family to pay the mortgage and other bills as needed. \r\n","<p>As a home owner, your mortgage is the most important tool that allows you to own and keep your home.
